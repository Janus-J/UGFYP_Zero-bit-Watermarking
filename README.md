# UGFYP_Zero-bit-Watermarking
Code is operated in MATLAB.
This project is divided into two parts: watermark generation and ID authentication.
For the first part, users can upload their fingerprint and images to generate an encrypted watermark and store it in the database in the MATAB, and you will also get a num which you can extract the original image and watermark from the database when needed.
For the second part, if users want to authenticate their ownership, only need to enter their num, then the system will simulate the attack combination then calculate the matching rate.
